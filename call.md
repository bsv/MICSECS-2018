# Call For Papers

The 10th Major Readings is organized as an International Conference on Software Engineering and Computer Systems (MR-ICSECS-2018). It is an international event dedicated to discussing research results and directions in the areas related to Software and Hardware Engeneering, Networks, Cyper-Physical Systems, Computer Security and Multimedia technologies.

The Conference gives a possibility to under- and post-graduate students to exchange their experience and results in perspective areas of research and development of Computer Systems.

## Research Track

The research track welcomes novel papers addressing theoretical, applied, and empirical aspects of research. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

### **Computer Systems and Networks**

* High-Performance Computing
* Computer Networks and Telecommunication
* Domain specific modelling and metamodelling
* Cloud Computing
* Virtualization
* Multi-core programming

### **Cyber-Physical Systems**

* Embedded Systems
* Computer Aided Design
* High-level synthesis
* Modelling and Co-simulation
* Robotics
* Internet of Things
* Ubiquitous computing

### **Computer Security**

* Computer Network Security
* Cryptography and Cryptanalysis
* Digital Forensics and Cybercrime Investigation
* Information Security and Privacy

### **Software Engineering**

* Programm languages
* Compilers
* Artificial Intelligent & machine learning
* Ontology Models and Semantic Web

* Augmented, virtual and mixed reality

## Poster papers and presentations

In addition to oral paper presentations MR-ICSECS-2018 encourages poster presentation.

Posters form an opportunity to informally present your research approach and results during the poster session of the conference. It is great for discussing your research in free form with all attendants of the session. Lots of people will be stopping by your poster and you will have a chance to talk to them, explain what you are doing, and get feedback. Of course, the number of people who will stop depends on how well you design your poster!

The best poster presentation will get an award!

## Submission

All authors will be required to pre-submit abstracts of their papers. Both papers and abstracts should be submitted via EasyChair.

## Important dates

All deadlines are for the Moscow time zone, 23:59.

* **Abstract submission**: 30 November 2018
* **Author notification**: 3 December 2018
* **Paper submission**: to be determined

## Proceedings

The best articles will be selected to publication in CEUR Workshop Proceedings (CEUR-WS.org). The articles in this proceedings are selectively indexed in DBLP (https://dblp.uni-trier.de/) and Scopus (https://www.scopus.com/).
