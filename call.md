# Call For Papers

The Majorov International Conference on Software Engineering and Computer Systems (**MICSECS 2019**) is an international event dedicated to discussing research results and directions in the areas related to Software and Hardware Engineering, Networks, Cyber-Physical Systems, Computer Security,  Multimedia technologies and AR/VR/MR technologies.

The conference gives a possibility to under- and post-graduate students to exchange their experience and results in perspective areas of research and development of Computer Systems.

## Submission

All authors will be required to pre-submit abstracts of their papers. All submissions will be carefully reviewed by the program committee.
**The acceptance rate** in the 2018 year was [0.73]({{ site.base_url }}/prev_conf.html).

## Poster presentations and Demo

In addition to oral paper presentations **MICSECS 2019** encourages poster presentation with Demo session. Demo session is dedicated to demonstrate how the results of participant researchers work. Beside posters the participants should present their executable models, devices and etc., which they have obtained during their work.

Posters & Demos form an opportunity to informally present your research approach at the conference. It is great for discussing your research in free form with all attendants of the session. Lots of people will be stopping by your poster and you will have a chance to talk to them, explain what you are doing, and get feedback. Of course, the number of people who will stop depends on how well you design your poster!

The best poster presentation will get an award!
