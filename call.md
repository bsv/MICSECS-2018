# Call For Papers

The Majorov International Conference on Software Engineering and Computer Systems (**MICSECS 2018**) is an international event dedicated to discussing research results and directions in the areas related to Software and Hardware Engeneering, Networks, Cyper-Physical Systems, Computer Security and Multimedia technologies. 

The conference is held for the 10th time and for the first time as an international one. 

The conference gives a possibility to under- and post-graduate students to exchange their experience and results in perspective areas of research and development of Computer Systems.

## Research Track

The research track welcomes novel papers addressing theoretical, applied, and empirical aspects of research. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

### **Computer Systems and Networks**

* High-Performance Computing
* Computer Networks and Telecommunication
* Domain specific modelling and metamodelling
* Cloud Computing
* Virtualization
* Multi-core programming

### **Cyber-Physical Systems**

* Embedded Systems
* Computer Aided Design
* High-level synthesis
* Modelling and Co-simulation
* Robotics
* Internet of Things
* Ubiquitous computing

### **Computer Security**

* Computer Network Security
* Cryptography and Cryptanalysis
* Digital Forensics and Cybercrime Investigation
* Information Security and Privacy

### **Software Engineering**

* Programm languages
* Compilers
* Artificial Intelligent & machine learning
* Ontology Models and Semantic Web
* Algorithms and Optimization

### **Multimedia Technologies and Computer Vision**

* Computer vision 
* Image processing and watermarking 
* Audio and video processing
* Motion and tracking
* Pattern Recognition
* Augmented, virtual and mixed reality

## Poster presentations and Demo

In addition to oral paper presentations **MICSECS 2018** encourages poster presentation with Demo session. Demo session is dedicated to demonstrate how the results of participant researchers work. Beside posters the participants should present their executable models, devices and etc., which they have obtained during their work.

Posters & Demos form an opportunity to informally present your research approach at the conference. It is great for discussing your research in free form with all attendants of the session. Lots of people will be stopping by your poster and you will have a chance to talk to them, explain what you are doing, and get feedback. Of course, the number of people who will stop depends on how well you design your poster!

The best poster presentation will get an award!

## Submission

All authors will be required to pre-submit abstracts of their papers. Both papers and abstracts should be submitted via EasyChair.

## Important dates

All deadlines are for the Moscow time zone, 23:59.

* **Abstract submission**: 2 December 2018
* **Author notification**: 10 December 2018
