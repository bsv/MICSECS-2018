## Rules

We know some rules are meant to be broken, but you should probably (definitely) stick by these

**1. Fresh Code** - We all start coding at the same time. It’s cool to work on designs beforehand, digital mockups, open 
source frameworks, and anything else available to everyone, but keep things within fair limits.

**2. Code Review** - Winning teams may be subject to a code-review at some point following the event or immediately before winning. This is to ensure that all code used is in fact fresh.

**3. Ownership and IP** - You own your IP and whatever you create. Simple as that.

**4. Team Size** - No more than five people not less two.

**5. Submissions** - You’ll receive an email with instructions on how to do just that. More information
will be given at the event.

**6. Demos** - You’ll demo the functionality of your project and talk through your idea. You’ll receive an email with instructions on how to do just that, more information will be given at the event.
